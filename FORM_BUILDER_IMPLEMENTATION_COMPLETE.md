# 🎉 Form Builder Feature - FULLY IMPLEMENTED & FIXED!

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **Component Import Issues**
- **Problem**: App.js was importing old `FormBuilder` instead of `EnhancedFormBuilder`
- **Solution**: Updated imports to use the enhanced components:
  - `EnhancedFormBuilder` for form creation/editing
  - `EnhancedSubmissionManagement` for analytics
  - `FormPreview` for testing forms

### 2. **Route Mismatch**
- **Problem**: FormManagement component linked to `/admin/forms/create` but route was `/admin/forms/new`
- **Solution**: Fixed link to match existing route `/admin/forms/new`

### 3. **Missing Backend Dependencies**
- **Problem**: Backend couldn't start due to missing `csv-writer` package
- **Solution**: Installed `csv-writer` dependency for form export functionality

### 4. **Models Not Loading**
- **Problem**: Form and FormSubmission models weren't being registered
- **Solution**: Backend now properly loads all models including forms
