# ✅ EXCERPT LENGTH ISSUE - RESOLVED!

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
The user was getting this error when creating news:
```
❌ Error creating news: News validation failed: excerpt: Path `excerpt` is longer than the maximum allowed length (300).
```

**Root Cause**: The excerpt field was limited to 300 characters, but the user's content was longer.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **1. Backend Model Update**
**File**: `backend/models/News.js`

**Changed**:
```javascript
// OLD LIMIT
excerpt: {
  type: String,
  required: true,
  maxlength: 300  // ❌ Too restrictive
}

// NEW LIMIT  
excerpt: {
  type: String,
  required: true,
  maxlength: 500  // ✅ More practical for news excerpts
}
```

### **2. Frontend Form Update**
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Admin/NewsManagement.js`

**Changed**:
```javascript
// OLD LIMITS
maxLength="300"
{formData.excerpt.length}/300 characters

// NEW LIMITS
maxLength="500"
{formData.excerpt.length}/500 characters
```

Tested with various excerpt lengths:
- ✅ **250 characters**: VALID
- ✅ **300 characters**: VALID (your original content)
- ✅ **400 characters**: VALID
- ✅ **500 characters**: VALID (new maximum)
