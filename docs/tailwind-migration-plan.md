# Bhavya Association Tailwind CSS Migration Plan

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the plan for migrating the Bhavya Association frontend to a centralized Tailwind CSS approach. The goal is to improve maintainability, consistency, and developer experience.

## 2. Current State

- Tailwind classes are used directly in components
- Inconsistent styling across components
- Duplicate styling patterns
- No centralized theme configuration
- Limited use of CSS variables

## 3. Migration Goals

- Centralize component styling
- Improve consistency across the application
- Reduce CSS duplication
- Improve maintainability
- Enhance developer experience

## 4. Migration Strategy

### Phase 2: Component Refactoring (In Progress)

- [x] Base Components
  - [x] Button
  - [x] Card
  - [x] FormInput
  - [x] Alert
  - [x] Badge
  - [x] Modal
