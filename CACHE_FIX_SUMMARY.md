# 404 Cache Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
You were experiencing 404 errors that resolved after clearing cache and reloading, indicating stale cached routes in your multi-page React app deployment.

## Root Cause
- Your `_redirects` file was configured for SPA (Single Page Application) behavior
- Browser and server caches were storing stale route responses
- HTML pages were being cached when they shouldn't be

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated `_redirects` file**
- **Before**: Redirected all routes to `index.html` (SPA behavior)
- **After**: Removed SPA redirects, added proper cache headers for different file types

### 2. **Enhanced `index.html`**
- Added cache-busting script that runs on page load
- Added stronger cache-control headers
- Added route cache clearing for refreshes

### 3. **Added Cache Utilities**
- `routeUtils.js` - Multi-page navigation helpers
- `MultiPageNavigation.js` - Traditional page navigation component
- Enhanced `cacheUtils.js` with multi-page specific cache clearing

### 4. **Updated Route Cache Debugger**
- Added "Page Reload" button for route-specific issues
- Improved cache clearing methods
- Better error detection for 404 issues

## What This Fixes
