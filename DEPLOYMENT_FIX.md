# Production Backend Deployment Fix

## Issue Summary
The production API at `api.bhavyasangh.com` is returning:
- 500 errors on POST /api/news (news creation)
- 404 errors on GET /api/news (news fetching)

## Root Cause
The production server is not running the latest backend code with the fixed News model.

## What Was Fixed
1. **News Model (models/News.js)**:
   - Changed `slug` field from `required: true` to `required: false` 
   - Improved slug generation in pre-save hook
   - Fixed duplicate index warning

2. **News Routes (routes/news.js)**:
   - Already had proper error handling and logging
   - Routes are properly registered in app.js

3. **Database Connection**:
   - Environment variables are properly configured
   - MongoDB connection is working locally

## Local Testing Results
✅ **Backend Server**: Running successfully on port 5000
✅ **Database**: Connected to MongoDB
✅ **GET /api/news**: Returns 200 with proper JSON response
✅ **POST /api/news**: Creates news items successfully (201 response)
✅ **News Model**: Slug generation working properly

## Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Production Backend Code
Deploy the latest backend code to the production server, especially:
- `models/News.js` (fixed slug generation)
- `routes/news.js` (proper error handling)
- `app.js` (news routes registration)

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure the production server has these environment variables:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://[production-mongo-connection]
JWT_SECRET=[secure-jwt-secret]
PORT=5000
```

### 3. Database Migration
If needed, update any existing news documents to have proper slugs:
```javascript
// Run this in production MongoDB if needed
db.news.updateMany(
  { slug: { $exists: false } },
  { $set: { slug: "temp-slug-" + new Date().getTime() } }
)
```

### 4. Server Restart
After deploying the code:
1. Stop the current production server process
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `node app.js`

### 5. Test Production Endpoints
After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `GET https://api.bhavyasangh.com/api/news` - should return 200
- `POST https://api.bhavyasangh.com/api/news` - should accept news creation

## Frontend Issues Fixed
The frontend is making requests to the correct endpoints:
- `https://api.bhavyasangh.com/api/news` (correct)
- The frontend API normalization is working properly

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the fixed backend code to production
2. Restart the production server
3. Test the news functionality in production
4. Remove debug code from frontend NewsManagement.js
5. Verify the marquee component is working with real data

## Files Changed
- `backend/models/News.js` - Fixed slug generation
- `backend/simple-test-server.js` - Created for testing
- `backend/test-news.js` - Created for model testing
- `backend/test-env.js` - Created for environment testing
